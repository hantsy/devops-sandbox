# Building a custom Oracle Database XE Docker Image

In these days, I was trying to connect an Oracle Database instance in my sample codes, but I found preparing it is really not easy.

Installing and configuring a complete full-featured Oracle Database Standard Edition(SE) or Enterprise Edition(EE) will waste your disk space and time. In before experience, I would like to run a dependent database server in Docker and focus on the application development.

Oracle has published official Docker Images of the  SE and EE  through Docker hub and its self-host [Container registry](https://container-registry.oracle.com/), but there is no a public XE version there. Fortunately Oracle maintains a [oracle/docker-images](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/) repo on Github which contains Dockerfiles for almost all Oracle products, including a XE version of Oracle Database.

Navigate to [OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/dockerfiles/18.4.0](https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/dockerfiles/18.4.0), fetch all files into your local disc, Let's build it for yourself.

Make sure you have installed Docker in your system.  For Windows/MacOS users, install the latest Docker for Windows/MacOS.

Enter the folder which contains the Dockerfile resource you have downloaded, then run the following command to build the Docker image.

```bash
docker build -t oracle/database:18.4.0-xe -f Dockerfile.xe .
```

Generally it will take some minutes to complete.

Unluckily it failed again and again here when fetching the oracle-database rpm file in my machine. To overcome this barrier, I decided to download the rpm file manually using an external download tool, then perform a small modification on the original *Dockerfile.xe* to make it install the local rpm instead of the remote URL.

Firstly , at line 41, replace the rpm URL with a local rpm file.

```bash
    INSTALL_FILE_1="oracle-database-xe-18c-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm" \
```

Secondly, in the **Copy binaries** section, add `$INSTALL_FILE_1` to the `COPY` command.

```bash
COPY $CHECK_SPACE_FILE $RUN_FILE $PWD_FILE $CHECK_DB_FILE $CONF_FILE $INSTALL_FILE_1 $INSTALL_DIR/
```

Then replace the `yum install` with the following.

```bash
    yum -y install file openssl oracle-database-preinstall-18c && \
    yum -y localinstall ./$INSTALL_FILE_1 && \
```

Check the complete modified Dockerfile from this [gist](https://gist.github.com/hantsy/57ed22ea775763ceceaebaa01182592b). And do not forget to put the downloaded rpm into the same folder of *Dockerfile.xe* file.

Execute the above docker build command again, it should be succeeded .

Open your terminal, run Oracle Database XE in a docker container.

```bash
docker run --name <container name> \
-p <host port>:1521 -p <host port>:5500 \
-e ORACLE_PWD=<your database passwords> \
-e ORACLE_CHARACTERSET=<your character set> \
-v [<host mount point>:]/opt/oracle/oradata \
oracle/database:18.4.0-xe
```
Alternatively, run it from a Docker Compose file. There is a Docker compose sample file to run Oracle Database XE .

```yaml
version: "3.5" # specify docker-compose version, v3.5 is compatible with docker 17.12.0+

# Define the services/containers to be run
services:
  oracledb:
    image: oracle/database:18.4.0-xe
    environment:
      - ORACLE_PWD=Passw0rd
#      - ORACLE_CHARACTERSET=AL32UTF8 # default is AL32UTF8
    volumes:
      - ./oradata:/opt/oracle/oradata # persistent oracle database data.
    ports:
      - 1521:1521 
      - 8080:8080 # apex
      - 5500:5500 # oemexpress
```

Start up an Oracle Database instance.

```bash
>docker-compose up

If it is the first time to run this command, it will take some time to prepare an Oracle instance for you. If you do not set a  password in the *docker-compose.yaml* file, it will generate one for you. 

When you see the **DATABASE IS READY TO USE!** is displayed, the database is ready for use.

Check the stauts of the running Docker container.

```bash
 docker ps
 CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                       COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                    PORTS                              NAMES
 7044c6afe68b        oracle/database:18.4.0-xe   "/bin/sh -c 'exec $Oâ€¦"   12 minutes ago      Up 12 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:1521->1521/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5500->5500/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp   oracle-jdbc-ds-war_oracledb_1
```

Anytime you can change password on an running Oracle instance.

```bash
> docker exec 7044c6afe68b ./setPassword.sh "Passw0rd"
The Oracle base remains unchanged with value /opt/oracle
